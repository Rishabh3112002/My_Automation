# *Automating Process While Starting A New Project*

## Introduction
This project automates all the processes involved while starting a new project, like creating a Git repository, initialising git, creating a README.md file and pushing the file to github by creating a shell command "create name_of_your_repository", to create a repository with that name and this name should be the same as your project. I used Python and shell commands to achieve the above mentioned.

## Requirements:-
1) ``
  pip install selenium
``
2) Git Bash

## Precautions:-
### For Windows Users:-
  1) First create a shell file in your root directory which will have a path like "C:/Users/Your_Root_Directory", because only if you create this file in the root driectory you will be able to access it in any directory.
  2) create you python file in the same directory if not then specify the path of the python file in your shell file.
  3) For Windows users you need to create a .bashrc and save it in your root directory.
### For Mac/Linux Distro Users:
You will not be required to do anything except change the format of the directories accordingly.

## Conclusion
By fulfilling the above mentioned Precautions and requirements you will be set to run the code to automate the process of starting a new Project.
